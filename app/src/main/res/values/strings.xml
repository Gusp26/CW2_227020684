    <string name="hgf">On the Hungry Ghost Festival, some areas in Hong Kong will organize Hungry Ghost Festivals to reward gods and sacrifice ghosts. There is also a saying that "Mu Lian saves his mother". It is said that a dutiful son Mu Lian couldn\'t bear his mother\'s suffering in the realm of hungry ghosts. The sacrifice is held in the seventh month of the lunar calendar, hoping that the mother will no longer be harassed by hungry ghosts. It can be seen that this is also a festival to promote filial piety. In Shenghui, a stage is generally set up and decorated with flower cards; there will be magical performances and sacrificial ceremonies on that night. The large flower cards are colorful and have become a very eye-catching signboard in the event. In addition to the purpose of offering sacrifices, the Yulan Festival is also an activity where folks gather, so we often see traces of groups and related materials on flower cards.</string>
